## Overview

This distributed system consists of multiple server nodes connected via custom communication protocols:

- Broadcast Protocol
- Anycast Protocol
- Multicast Protocol (optional)

The system is containerized using Docker for easy setup and replication.

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

- Docker
- Docker Compose

### Steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-link>
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

   ```bash
   cd distributed_project
   ```

3. **Build and Start the Containers:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

## Usage

After starting the containers, the master server node will be accessible at port 5000 (or your chosen port).

To interact with the system, [describe any client-side operations, HTTP calls, scripts, or UI, if any].

For example:

```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/api_endpoint
```

## Testing

We have implemented various test cases to validate the communication protocols.

To run the tests, [provide specific steps or commands, if any].

## Monitoring

Network activities among the nodes can be monitored using [your chosen tool, e.g., built-in logging, Wireshark, etc.].

Logs capturing all required fields such as Time, Source_IP, Destination_IP, etc., can be found at [specify the location, e.g., `logs/communication.log`].
